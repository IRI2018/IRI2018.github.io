                            This year's conference is dedicated to the memory of <em><strong>Prof. Lotfi Zadeh</strong></em>, Honorary Chair and <em><strong>Prof. Thouraya Bouabana-Tebibel</strong></em>. 
                            Both Thouraya and Lotfi were among the warmest of personalities. 
                            They will be missed, but not forgotten.

													<em><strong>Professor Lotfi Zadeh</strong></em> was a frequent keynote speaker at IRI conferences. He showed us how reuse was an inherently fuzzy concept – setting the stage for knowledge acquisition. He taught us that when someone insults you, you take it as a compliment. Moreover, Professor Zadeh entwined a sense of humor, hard work, and good science with a sense of adventure. Fuzzy numbers were extensions of logic. Computing with words was an extension of speech. He held that nothing is worth doing unless you believed in it; and, if you don’t believe in yourself, the outside world will not believe in your words either. Professor Zadeh will be missed; albeit, he will be by our side in death as in life.

                                                    <em><strong>Professor Thouraya Bouabana-Tebibel</strong></em> ran the conferences formal workshop for many years. She was a kind soul, an ardent researcher, and an excellent educator. She published many conference papers and pursued formal approaches to data science. Professor Tebibel will be remembered for her tireless efforts, her many students, and her pursuit of AI through reuse and randomization. The conference cannot be the same without her; but, her teachings surely put us all on the road to success. Professor Tebibel was a great woman, a role model, and a source of inspiration for us all. She will be sadly missed.

													Reuse and integration is not limited to the information world. This talk will cover the history of Naval technology development. It will be seen that new technologies have been adapted and reused for defense applications. In particular, the history of Naval science and technology in San Diego will be highlighted. We will cover how technology has been reused and integrated to create some recent military and civilian capabilities and explore how this trend is expected to continue and accelerate in the future. The talk will cover the history of Navy technology on Point Loma, the Navy Radio Lab through NOSC to SSC Pacific today. We will discuss a plethora of technical areas and their evolution (in some cases revolution). The pivotal role of reuse and integration in the development of hardware of all types will be emphasized.

													Cognitive systems, systems that incorporate significant artificial intelligence (AI) functionality, have become ubiquitous in recent years. Major technology companies invest significant efforts in providing AI functionality, either to use in their own services or to help customers build cognitive applications. Enabling AI for business has become a major effort for IBM Research. This keynote will provide an overview of core research topics, challenges and solutions to build AI applications, and will put a particular effort on the issue of integrating cognitive applications and services with the data they rely on at training and inference time. This requires a novel approach to manage the integration of compute resources with data sources and destinations, both for AI in the data center and Cloud as well as on distributed devices in mobile settings or the Internet of Things.

													The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm refers to the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with servers, centralized systems,  and/or other connected devices based on a variety of communication infrastructures. IoT makes it possible to sense and control objects creating opportunities for more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems. IoT will usher automation in a large number of application domains, ranging from manufacturing and energy management (e.g. SmartGrid), to healthcare management and urban life (e.g. SmartCity). However, because of its fine-grained, continuous and pervasive data acquisition and control capabilities, IoT raises concerns about security and privacy. Deploying existing security solutions to IoT is not straightforward because of device heterogeneity, highly dynamic and possibly unprotected environments, and large scale. In this talk, after outlining key challenges in IoT security and privacy, we present initial approaches to securing IoT data, including firewall techniques to prevent IoT devices to be compromised and used by botnets.

This talk will discuss our BIRD project, which represents an attempt to build swarm intelligence into UAVs, which goes beyond deep learning and statistical data mining. Algorithmic decomposition and reuse play a central role in development. The need for knowledge amplification, the KASER, and where permissible, hints of what's to come will be provided.

                            Given the emerging global Information-centric IT landscape that has tremendous social and
                            economic implications, effectively processing and integrating humungous volumes of information
                            from diverse sources to enable effective decision making and knowledge generation have become
                            one of the most significant challenges of current times. <em>Information Reuse</em> and
                            <em>Integration for Data Science</em> (IRI)
                            seeks to maximize the reuse of information by creating simple, rich, and reusable knowledge
                            representations and consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into
                            systems and applications. IRI plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance,
                            integration, validation, and extrapolation of information; and applies both information and
                            knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains.
                        
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            This conference explores three major tracks: <em>information reuse</em>,
                            <em>information integration</em>, and <em>reusable systems</em>. <em>Information reuse</em>
                            explores theory and practice of optimizing representation; <em>information integration</em>
                            focuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for applying integration approaches in novel
                            domains; and <em>reusable systems</em>focus on developing and deploying models and corresponding
                            processes that enable <em>Information Reuse</em> and <em>Integration</em>
                            to play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application domains.

                            The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia,
                            industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world
                            problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included.
                            The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels and
                            keynote speeches.
