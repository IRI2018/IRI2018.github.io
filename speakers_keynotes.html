                                                    Cognitive systems, systems that incorporate significant artificial intelligence (AI) functionality, have become ubiquitous in recent years. Major technology companies invest significant efforts in providing AI functionality, either to use in their own services or to help customers build cognitive applications. Enabling AI for business has become a major effort for IBM Research. This keynote will provide an overview of core research topics, challenges and solutions to build AI applications, and will put a particular effort on the issue of integrating cognitive applications and services with the data they rely on at training and inference time. This requires a novel approach to manage the integration of compute resources with data sources and destinations, both for AI in the data center and Cloud as well as on distributed devices in mobile settings or the Internet of Things.

                                                   Throughout his career he was mostly dealing with the issues of scaling of systems and systems that cross organizational boundaries. Both are technically challenging topics that evolve over time with the platforms we use and the applications we like to run on, from B2B applications on the early Internet to issues of mobile systems using the Cloud - IaaS or PaaS. How to build systems and services that scale? How to monitor, manage performance and manage SLAs of these systems effectively. How to reach over organizational boundaries, e.g., connecting processes of different providers, in a robust and secure way.

                                                <p class="text-justify">

                                                    Reuse and integration is not limited to the information world. This talk will cover the history of Naval technology development. It will be seen that new technologies have been adapted and reused for defense applications. In particular, the history of Naval science and technology in San Diego will be highlighted. We will cover how technology has been reused and integrated to create some recent military and civilian capabilities and explore how this trend is expected to continue and accelerate in the future. The talk will cover the history of Navy technology on Point Loma, the Navy Radio Lab through NOSC to SSC Pacific today. We will discuss a plethora of technical areas and their evolution (in some cases revolution). The pivotal role of reuse and integration in the development of hardware of all types will be emphasized.

                                                    The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm refers to the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with servers, centralized systems,  and/or other connected devices based on a variety of communication infrastructures. IoT makes it possible to sense and control objects creating opportunities for more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems. IoT will usher automation in a large number of application domains, ranging from manufacturing and energy management (e.g. SmartGrid), to healthcare management and urban life (e.g. SmartCity). However, because of its fine-grained, continuous and pervasive data acquisition and control capabilities, IoT raises concerns about security and privacy. Deploying existing security solutions to IoT is not straightforward because of device heterogeneity, highly dynamic and possibly unprotected environments, and large scale. In this talk, after outlining key challenges in IoT security and privacy, we present initial approaches to securing IoT data, including firewall techniques to prevent IoT devices to be compromised and used by botnets.

                                                    Professor Elisa Bertino joined Purdue in January 2004 as professor in Computer Science and research director at CERIAS. Her research interests cover many areas in the fields of information security and database systems. Her research combines both theoretical and practical aspects, addressing applications on a number of domains, such as medicine and humanities. Current research includes: access control systems, secure publishing techniques and secure broadcast for XML data; advanced RBAC models and foundations of access control models; trust negotiation languages and privacy; data mining and security; multi-strategy filtering systems for Web pages and sites; security for grid computing systems; integration of virtual reality techniques and databases; and geographical information systems and spatial databases.

                                                    Currently UAVs are controlled by finite state machines. This talk will discuss our BIRD project, which represents an attempt to build swarm intelligence into UAVs, which goes beyond deep learning and statistical data mining. Algorithmic decomposition and reuse play a central role in development. The need for knowledge amplification, the KASER, and where permissible, hints of what's to come will be provided.

                                                    Dr. Stuart Rubin is a research scientist in the Advanced Concepts and Applied Research Branch at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific), Code 71740, and a Fellow of the Society for Information Reuse and Integration (SIRI) and the National Academy of Inventors (NAI). He is the author or co-author of over 300 publications and over 35 issued patents assigned to the Navy. He is the inventor of the KASER knowledge amplifier, which was first applied to the F-16 radar fault-diagnostic system with other applications pending. His focus areas of interest include computational creativity and knowledge-discovery systems - emphasizing heuristic, evolutionary, fuzzy, and randomization-based methodologies.
