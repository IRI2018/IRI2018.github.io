                                This conference presents excellent, novel, and contemporary papers covering all aspects of Data – including Scientific Theory and Technology-Based Applications. New data analytic algorithms, technologies, and tools are sought to be able to manage, integrate, and utilize large amounts of data despite hardware, software, and/or bandwidth constraints; to construct models yielding important data insights; and, to create visualizations to aid in presenting and understanding the data. System development and integration needs to also adapt to these new algorithms, technologies, tools, and needs. This conference and its constituents support the development of technologies and applications for peaceful purposes to improve the human condition.

                                Furthermore, IRI addresses the representation, cleansing, generalization, validation, and reasoning strategies for the scientifically-sound and cost-effective advancement of all systems and systems of systems (SoS) – including all software and hardware aspects. These non-trivial tasks lead to challenging research problems – for example, how to optimally select the information/data sets for reuse and how to optimize the integration of existing information/knowledge with new, developing information/knowledge sources!

                                The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both welcome. The conference program will include several plenary speeches from academia, industry, and government; special sessions, open forum workshops, and panels.

                                <strong>Best Paper Award:</strong> Starting this year, the IEEE IRI Awards Committee will be presenting an award for the Best Theory and/or Applicative Paper. The best paper will be selected by distinct committee and will be the one that reports the most novel and promising research work that has a high potential impact in the real world. Additional select awards will also be presented.
