                                    Nowadays, multimedia data allow fast and effective communication and sharing of information about peoples’ lives, their behaviors, work, and interests, but they are also the digital testimony of facts, objects, and locations. In such a context, Social Media Networks (SMNs) actually represent a natural environment where users can create and share multimedia content such as text, images, video, audio, and so on. Just as an example, each minute thousands of tweets are sent on Twitter, several hundreds of hours of videos are uploaded to YouTube, and a huge amount of photos are shared on Instagram or uploaded to Flickr. Within these “interest-based” networks, each user interacts with the others through multimedia content (text, image, video, audio) and such interactions create “social links” that well characterize the behaviors of the users. Here, in addition to social information (e.g., tags, opinions, insights, evaluations, perspectives, ratings, and user profiles) multimedia data can play a “key-role” especially from the perspective of Social Network Analysis (SNA): representing and understanding multimedia characteristics and user-to-item interaction mechanisms can be useful to predict user behavior, model the evolution of multimedia content and social graphs, design human-centric multimedia applications and services, just to make a few examples.

                                </p>
								<p class="text-justify">
								In particular, SMNs are becoming truly pervasive, encompassing every aspect of our digital life. While the widespread adoption of SMNs by virtually all small and large businesses, as well as many individual users, has enormous benefits in terms of dissemination of and access to information, the diverse nature of the content shared on SMNs (text, video, audio) poses new and interesting challenges with respect to information reuse and integration. The International Workshop on Social Media Networks Analytics and Applications (SMA2) aims to address these critical challenges by bringing together scientists, engineers, practitioners, and students in an interdisciplinary forum where they can share experiences and ideas, discuss the results of their research on models, methodologies and algorithms, and forge new collaborations that will lead to the development of new applications and tools to transform information extracted from SMNs into actionable intelligence.
